Lecture 2: sampling, filtering, convolution, and digital data formats

Additional notes from lecture 2:

- if you copy large data files, especially over the network, use
robocopy on windows or rsync on mac/linux. These programs copy
your files and verify that they were copied without errors. The
regular copy-by-dragging-folder method corrupts files surprisingly
often.

- It is worth repeating: the failure rate of hard drives is 100%.
