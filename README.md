Website for "Approaches to Study Neural Circuits"

The class is now finished. All 11 lectures are now recorded and available 
to watch. All course materials (including video links) are under the "code"
tab, or the "View code" folder if you're on a mobile device.

We have done our best to ensure all of the course material is accurate,
and we will add a corrections.txt file in each lecture folder.

If there are any questions or problems, or if you note any inaccuracies
or important omissions, email luke@sjulsonlab.org
