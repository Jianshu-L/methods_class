Additional notes for lecture 3 (i.e. things I forgot to mention):

- one of the big limitations of almost all electrode-based ephys
approaches is that they are only stable for a limited period of time.
For intracellular recordings, a couple of hours at best. For 
extracellular recordings, they could be stable for much longer 
than that, but unless you record continuously 24 hrs/day, it is
impossible to know whether the units you see on Tuesday were the
same ones you saw on Monday. So one major advantage of calcium
imaging is the possibility of tracking the same cells longitudinally
over time, which is useful for studying learning, memory, drug
addiction, etc.

- I forgot to talk about this, but the newest electrode technology
for extracellular recordings is to make electrodes printed on 
flexible plastic coils. You wrap the flexible coils around a thin
needle and attach them with water-soluble nontoxic glue. Then you
insert the needle into the brain, allow the glue to dissolve, and 
pull the needle out. The flexibility of the electrodes approximately
matches the mechanical properties of the brain, so they flex and 
move with the brain tissue. In some studies, the electrodes were 
still working perfectly after six months of recording, and it is
possible they would be stable for years. It is worth pointing out
that previous studies have found that the main cause of gliosis 
and cell death around electrode sites is the chronic motion of 
the electrode back and forth, mechanically traumatizing the tissue. 

- I am also including the PDF of the Delgado paper from 1970
showing wireless recordings in a freely moving chimpanzee.
