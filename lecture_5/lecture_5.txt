Tiago's notes:
- many FPs have significant pH sensitivity (e.g. Citrine)
- FPs can show "blinking" behavior, where their light output goes up and down
(interesting biophysics but not relevant in most neuroscience applications
- DsRed and some red FP's start off green and slowly mature into the red state.
Most modern RFP's don't have this issue.
- another important factor complicating analysis of GCaMP data is when there is 
heterogeneous GCaMP expression across the cell population, e.g. if you 
use AAV.
