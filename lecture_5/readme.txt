hi everyone,

The Sabatini paper discusses the influence of reporter kinetics on interpretation
of imaging experiments, including a discussion of a controversial high-profile 
result about dopamine that he argues may be artifactual. Everything he says 
applies to optogenetic experiments as well.

The review paper that I wrote focuses on the topic of how to target transgenes 
to specific neurons of interest and the various pitfalls you have to watch for.
I wrote this review because people ask me questions about this all the time,
and I wanted there to be a guide that collects all the information in one place.
It is up to date, with a few exceptions: 1) since then, people have had
success with transsynaptic anterograde transduction of cells using AAV-1 expressing
Cre or Flp. Flp is better because high-level Cre expression is toxic, and you
frequently get toxicity at the injection site. 2) AAVs with mutant capsids that
transduce axon terminals with higher efficiency now exist ("retroAAV"). These
work well in some cell types but not others. 3) Ben Deverman has developed
the PHP capsids for AAV, which are mutant AAV9 capsids that were selected for
their ability to access neurons from the bloodstream. People now routinely
inject those AAVs intravenously in mice and can get fairly uniform labeling of
neurons in the entire brain (with low copy numbers of viral genomes/cell). 
4) Several different groups are making progress by finding short distal 
enhancer elements in the genome that can be used in AAVs to target specific
cell types. Jordane Dimidschstein is the one who pioneered this, and he and Ben
are collaborating now. Combining those technologies successfully would 
reduce our dependence on transgenic animals substantially and enable these
technologies to be used in a wider range of animals (including primates).
We will not discuss the topic of transgene targeting in class, but I 
recommend that you read through the paper. There are far too many serious 
mistakes that people have made because they did not understand these principles.
